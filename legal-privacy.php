                    <li>Undertaking activities to verify or maintain the quality of a service or device that is owned,

                <H2>4. Verifiable Consumer Requests for Information</H2>
                Upon verification of identity, California residents may in some cases request that a business:
                <ul>
                    <li>Disclose the categories of personal information the business collected about the consumer;</li>
                    <li>Disclose the categories of sources from which the personal information is collected</li>
                    <li>Disclose the categories of personal information that the business sold about the consumer;</li>
                    <li>Disclose the categories of personal information that the business disclosed about the consumer
                        for a business purpose;</li>
                    <li>Disclose the categories of third parties with whom the business shares personal information</li>
                    <li>Disclose specific pieces of personal information the business has collected about the consumer
                    </li>
                    <li>Disclose any financial incentives offered by the business for collection, sale, or deletion of
                        personal information</li>
                </ul>
                A business may charge a different price or rate, or provide a different level or quality of goods or
                services to you, if that difference is reasonably related to the value provided to you by your personal
                information.</p><p>
                For applicable personal information access and portability requests, we will select a format to provide
                your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from
                one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p><p>
                Please note that we are not required to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Retain any personal information about you that was collected for a single one-time transaction
                        if, in the ordinary course of business, that information about you is not retained;</li>
                    <li>Reidentify or otherwise link any data that, in the ordinary course of business, is not
                        maintained in a manner that would be considered personal information;</li>
                    <li>Provide the requested information disclosure to you more than twice in a 12-month period.</li>
                    <li>Provide the requested information disclosure if we cannot verify that the person making the
                        request is the person about whom we collected information, or is someone authorized to act on
                        such person’s behalf; or</li>
                    <li>Provide the requested information disclosure if a CCPA or applicable exception applies.</li>
                </ul>
                <H2>5. Right to Request Deletion of Personal Information</H2>
                Upon verification of identity, California residents may in some cases request that we delete personal
                information about you that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions.
                We may deny your deletion request if we are acting in the role of a service provider to another business
                regarding the applicable personal information. If we deny your request on that basis, we will generally
                refer you to the relevant business. In addition, we may deny your deletion request if retaining the
                information is necessary for us or our service providers to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Complete the transaction for which the personal information was collected, provide a good or
                        service requested by you, or reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business
                        relationship with you, or otherwise perform a contract between you and us.</li>
                    <li>Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal
                        activity; or prosecute those responsible for that activity.</li>
                    <li>Debug to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.</li>
                    <li>Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise his or her right of free
                        speech, or exercise another right provided for by law.</li>
                    <li>Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act.</li>
                    <li>Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public
                        interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when our deletion of the
                        information is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of such research,
                        provided we have obtained your informed consent.</li>
                    <li>Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with your expectations based on your
                        relationship with us.</li>
                    <li>Comply with a legal obligation.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise use your personal information, internally, in a lawful manner that is compatible with
                        the context in which you provided the information; or</li>
                    <li>If another CCPA or applicable exception applies.</li>
                </ul>
                California residents may submit verifiable requests for information or deletion described herein by
                emailing us at ccparequest@fncbinc.com / or calling us at (800) 824-6191
            </p>
            <p>
                <H2>6. Verifying Your Identity If You Submit CCPA Requests</H2>
                If you choose to contact us directly via the designated methods described above to exercise your CCPA
                rights, you will need to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Provide enough information to reasonably identify you [(e.g., your full name, account number if
                        applicable, and potentially other identifying information]; and</li>
                    <li>Describe your request with sufficient detail to allow us to properly process and respond to your
                        request.</li>
                </ul>
                We are not obligated to make an information disclosure or carry out a deletion request pursuant to the
                CCPA if we cannot verify that the person making the request is the person about
                whom we collected information, or is someone authorized to act on such person’s behalf.
                Any personal information we collect from you in order to verify your identity in connection with your
                CCPA request will be used solely for the purposes of verification.
