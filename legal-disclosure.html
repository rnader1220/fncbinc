                <h4>FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS</h4>
                The state Rosenthal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices
                Act require that, except under unusual circumstances, collectors may not contact you before 8:00 a.m. or
                after 9:00 p.m. They may not harass you by using threats of violence or arrest or by using obscene
                language. Collectors may not use false or misleading statements or call you at work if they know or have
                reason to know that you may not receive personal calls at work. For the most part, collectors may not
                tell another person, other than your attorney or spouse, about your debt. Collectors may contact another
                person to confirm your location or enforce a judgement. For more information about debt collection
                activities, you may contact the Federal Trade Commission at 1-877-FTC-HELP or www.ftc.gov.
                You may request records showing the following:
                <ol>
                    <li>that the current creditor to whom the debt is owed
                        has the right to seek collection of the debt; </li>
                    <li> the debt balance, including an explanation of any
                        interest charges and additional fees; </li>
                    <li> the date of default or the date of the last payment; </li>
                    <li> the
                        name of the charge-off creditor and the account number associated with the debt; </li>
                    <li>the name and last
                        known address of the debtor as it appeared in the charge-off creditor’s or debt buyer’s records
                        prior to
                        the sale of the debt, as appropriate; and </li>
                    <li>the names of all persons or entities that have purchased
                        the debt.</li>
                </ol>
                You may also request from us a copy of the contract or other document evidencing your
                agreement to the debt. A request for these records may be addressed to: 50 W. Liberty Street Suite 250
